# folder-locker
This is a simple C# program which allows you to create a private folder.
This folder will be protected with a password and hidden until you insert the unlock code (for now it is hard-coded).
The program automatically detects if the folder is locked or unlocked and shows the correct prompt for the user.
If the the folder doesn't exist yet, it will automatically create it. So if the folder is renamed since the paths are hard-coded as well
